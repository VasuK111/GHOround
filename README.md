### GHOround

GHOround is the state-of-the-art platform where anyone round the globe can become a part of a new emerging ecosystem of **lending & borrowing AI models** 
that has GHO - AaVE's stablecoin as it's backbone.

* Users can come & build their trading strategies for various tokens of different DEXs & chains & then create models for them. 
* They can lend those models to borrowers( credit Delegation with Signature) & get a upfront fees in GHO tokens.
  The transactions on cross chains/DEXs will be done securely through CCIP.
* For making those models available for lending, they'll have to follow a Proof-of-Stake mechanism
  where they will stake a certain amount of GHO which then goes to the Aave DAO Treasury.
* The [creditDelegationVault.sol](https://github.com/VasuK111/Swallet/blob/c4bfc3da43428c15962dc5c224301105fce16c78/contracts/creditDelegationVault.sol) will be signed between model lender & borrower which will have a fixed deadline when the model has to be returned & also the interest that the user will have to pay throughout the period on a regular basis.
